# LS-Hackathon-CLI-Project

## Lambda School CLI ##

### Objective ###
A lot of the times, lessons take a bit to get started, because not everyone can get up and running right away. Our goal is to build a CLI that offers a way to spin up pre-declared development environments using docker. Something like this could drastically change lecture/sprint start up time and would be extremely beneficial for many students.
